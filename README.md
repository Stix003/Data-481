Hi,

My name is Vaanyi.

The purpose of this repository is to mark my introduction to GitHub. Although I'm not really new to version control, or Git for that matter; I've just been using GitLab as opposed to GitHub. 

I will now attempt to list some of the instructions for this project, but in "TO-DO list" form. 

- [ ] In the upper right corner, the should be a “+” sign 
- [ ] Click the + sign and select New Repository
- [ ] Type in a description of the project
- [ ] Make sure your repository is public.
- [ ] Initialize the repository with a README. 
- [ ] Select create
- [ ] Go to your new repository. 
- [ ] Click the drop down menu at the top left of the file list called branch: master
- [ ] Type a new branch name (README-edit) into the text box
- [ ] Select the blue Create branch box.
